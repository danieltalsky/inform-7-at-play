The Beautiful Breezeway is a room.  

The description of the beautiful breezeway is 
"This is the fanciest breezeway you've ever been in.  
It's just a place to take off your boots, but the 
coat hooks are made of filigreed platinum and the
shoehorns are made of solid gold, which hardly seems
practical.".

There is a shiny apple in the Beautiful Breezeway.
It is edible.
