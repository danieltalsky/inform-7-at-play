coat hooks are made of filigreed platinum and the
shoehorns are made of solid gold, which hardly seems
practical.".

There is a shiny apple in the Beautiful Breezeway.
It is edible.

## TO DO: Reminders to myself:

### Technical
- Inform 7 output -> markdown converter (python?)
- Figure out a way to let github code blocks wrap so it can work on mobile.

### Content 

- Do a "how to do Hit Points if you REALLY must" section.
