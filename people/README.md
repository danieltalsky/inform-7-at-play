# Inform 7: People, People, People

It's a lot easier to make a convincing bouncy ball in your fictional world than convincing people, but it's worth a try.

People are complicated, though so let's start simple.  With a rhino.

```inform7
The Serengeti is a room. "It's not just endless sand dunes.  There are trees, for instance."

There is a shiny apple in the Serengeti.

The rhino is an animal in the Serengeti. 

The description of the rhino is "You never really realize how big one of these things is until you're up close.  Seriously.  You're too close."
```

All we have to do is say the rhino is an animal and not a thing and right away we get some different behavior than a regular piece of scenery.
